# Walk Cleveland

## Introduction
This repository is the final capstone completed for bootcamp that I attended. The aim of the project was to create an application that the user could user to find different points of interest in the area near them. They are also able to search by keyword and category.  

Part of the application focused on the gamification of the user experience. Users are able to check into locations that they are near to, and the can earn badges for completing certain challenges.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I have the ability for the system to detect my current location and then show me nearby locations that I can visit.

2. As a non-user, I can register to the application so that I can be a user.

3. As a user, I can log in to the system so that I can use the application.

4. As a registered user, I can "check-in" at a location when I get there.

5. As a user visiting CLE, I can be incentivized to visit more locations by receiving badges/awards for my check-ins. Example badges include, but are not limited to:

    - Defender of the Land (for visiting every location)
    - Bar Hopper (for visiting 5 bars within a small location)
    - Sports Enthusiast (for visiting all of the sports stadiums)
    - Tree Hugger (for visiting the CLE parks)


6. As a logged-in user, I can view my check-in history so that I can know where I have visited and what badges I have acquired so far.

7. As any user, I need to be able to view the details of a WalkCLE stop so that I can see information and historical details. Information includes:

    - name
    - description
    - available days/hours
    - venue type
    - image(s)
    - access to any information on social media about the venue

8. As any user to the website, I need to be able to search through a list of curated stops so that I can see which locations can be visited. Search Criteria can include:

    - keyword
    - category (i.e. food, arts & entertainment, parks & recreation, events, shopping & dining, etc.)

9. As a user looking at a nearby location, I can see walking or driving directions to get there from my current location.

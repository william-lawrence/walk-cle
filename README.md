# Walk Cleveland

## Introduction
This repository is the final capstone completed for bootcamp that I attended. The aim of the project was to create an application that the user could user to find different points of interest in the area near them. They are also able to search by keyword and category.  

Part of the application focused on the gamification of the user experience. Users are able to check into locations that they are near to, and the can earn badges for completing certain challenges.
